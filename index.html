                          Lowboknow is a <span class="faq-emphasis">complementi&nbsp;</span> to Proboknow. It’s a marketplace for affordable legal help, where you can find attorneys who have committed to representing clients on a “low bono” basis. Low bono representation is not free; rather, it’s more affordable. A substantial portion of the American population makes too much money to qualify for pro bono (free) legal help, but still can’t afford standard legal fees; low bono representation is for them. It’s also for those who do qualify for pro bono help but either can’t find an attorney who is willing to help for free, or whose legal issue requires urgent representation, and can afford to pay <span class="faq-emphasis">something&nbsp;</span> for legal services. It’s completely free for you to list your case on Lowboknow.

You might be able to find an attorney who is unable to represent you for free, but is willing to take on your case, or a part of it, for an affordable fee.

			Free legal help is meant for those who cannot afford it. Attorneys commit an extraordinary amount of time and effort to provide legal representation; when they provide such representation on a pro bono basis (i.e., for free), they are doing so in order to help someone who cannot afford to pay. Furthermore, demand for free legal representation vastly outstrips the supply of free legal representation, so, it is crucial that those who receive it are the ones who need it most.

Attorneys on the <a href="http://www.lowboknow.com" target="_blank">Lowboknow</a> marketplace are committed to providing low bono services – that is, legal representation at an affordable rate.

			While Proboknow is constantly working hard to increase the number of attorneys on the platform, unfortunately there is no guarantee that an attorney will represent you. Generally speaking, not everyone who seeks out representation has a valid legal claim. Moreover, there is a high demand for free legal representation, and while Proboknow is trying to increase the availability of pro bono representation, the supply of representation simply does not meet the demand. While you are waiting to connect with free legal help on Proboknow, you can simultaneously have your case listed for <span class="faq-emphasis">free</span> on the <a href="http://www.lowboknow.com" target="_blank">Lowboknow</a> affordable legal services marketplace, to increase your chances of matching with the legal help that you need more quickly.

                <span>
			No. Proboknow makes no guarantees regarding case outcomes. Proboknow does not provide representation, and is in no position to make any assurances regarding representation. Proboknow is merely a platform for connecting clients and attorneys.

Therefore, you should provide only a brief, general description of your case, and not include any information that is sensitive, confidential or potentially embarrassing.

                          The short answer is – anyone looking to gain experience through pro bono practice. This includes experienced attorneys who are shifting into a new area of practice. Proboknow would like to encourage <span class="faq-emphasis">each</span> and <span class="faq-emphasis">every attorney</span> to become engaged in pro bono work, and to sign up for the platform. However, experienced attorneys are particularly encouraged to sign up as mentors, so that they can guide new attorneys through their pro bono cases, rather than representing the pro bono clients directly – thereby not only ensuring valuable representation for the client but also valuable training for the attorney.

                          It’s also possible to mentor in some areas and be a mentee in others. For example, you might have a decade of experience in family law, and be  willing to mentor others in family law, but at the same time be looking to transition to another area of law , in which you can be a mentee.

                        <p>
                          Attorneys on Proboknow are <span class="faq-emphasis">encouraged</span> to consider limited scope representation (variously known as discrete task representation, a la carte services, or unbundled services, among other similarly confusing names). With limited scope, instead of handling all parts of a case, the attorney and client agree from the outset which parts of the case the attorney will do, and which the client will do. Simple as that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Of course, not every case works well with limited scope representation, and when it does work, the attorney and client need to be crystal clear on the scope of the agreement and the distribution of responsibilities. Where it’s difficult to break the work into discrete components, or where the attorney’s partial involvement would harm the client’s interests (e.g. complex tax issues), limited scope is not the right tool. But when it fits, consulting with the client, drafting a motion, performing legal research, or even representation at a single hearing can greatly advance a client’s case while keeping the scope of work within the pro bono attorney’s available time. For a list of best practices when using limited scope, see <a href="http://albertalegalservices.com/project_resources/harvie_boyd-best_practices.pdf" target="_blank">this guide</a> by the Alberta Limited Legal Services Project.

                          If you’re new to limited scope, you may wish to check out PLI’s training on <a href="http://www.pli.edu/Content/OnDemand/Expanding_Your_Practice_Using_Limited_Scope/_/N-4nZ1z12610" target="_blank">limited scope representation</a>, along with their training on <a href="https://www.pli.edu/Content/OnDemand/Ethical_Issues_in_California_Pro_Bono_Representation/_/N-4nZ1z10lae" target="_blank">ethical issues in California pro bono representation</a>. Both are free and both come with stellar materials that are well worth reading.

                          Additionally, Sue Talia has put together excellent limited scope risk management materials at <a href="http://www.unbundledlaw.org" target="_blank">http://www.unbundledlaw.org</a>, including sample fee agreements/retainers (which you should use regardless whether the case is pro bono or not, because the fee agreement/retainer spells out the scope of the representation).

                          If you have enough experience to guide a newer attorney through a case, then you can make a difference for both a client in need of pro bono work and for an attorney looking to gain experience. If your experience is combined with a desire to either help indigent clients with their cases, or newer attorneys with their professional development, then you should sign up.
                          If you are an experienced attorney who is already engaged in, or is entertaining the thought of, directly helping pro bono clients, then you might consider becoming a mentor instead, or in addition to your own pro bono work. The advantages of serving as a mentor on a case, as opposed to directly handling the case yourself, are significant. By mentoring a newer attorney on a case, not only can you ensure that the client receives quality legal help, but you can also help train a new attorney in need of guidance and practical experience. Furthermore, as you already know, there is quite a bit of grunt work involved in pro bono representation; for the newer attorney, this grunt work represents valuable experience, whereas for you it might just be a pain in the rear or time you could be working on a more complicated pro bono case.

Each case is briefly described in the prospective client’s own words, guided by our automated intake process. If you are interested in a particular case, then you will be provided with the client’s contact information, so that you can learn more about the case. You can either actively search for a case on which you would like to mentor a new attorney, or you can wait for a new attorney to invite you to mentor him/her on a case.

                          Proboknow is configured so that attorneys search for cases, rather than clients searching for attorneys. When an attorney takes on a client, the client is obviously provided with the attorney’s contact information. However, as a mentor, you need not interact with the client yourself - the mentee can handle client communications; but, the choice is yours. Therefore, whether you provide your contact information to the client is entirely your choice.

                        <p>
                          Your contact information will, however, be available to attorneys searching for mentors (and vice versa - their contact information will be available to you).

			No. Proboknow is merely a platform for connecting attorneys with clients and with one another. It is not a firm, and does not provide malpractice coverage. <span class="faq-emphasis-only-bold">However, if an attorney is interested in a pro bono case and needs malpractice coverage</span>, we can reach out to partner legal services organizations to see if he/she can represent the client on their behalf; in that case, the attorney would be covered by their umbrella malpractice policy. If you would like to explore this option, please write to us.

                          Absolutely not. You can mentor anyone in a jurisdiction where you are licensed. Obviously it’s easiest to mentor someone in a county where you know all the judges and the local rules, so if you choose to mentor someone out of county, ensure that your mentee checks the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/3027.htm" target="_blank">local rules</a>.
